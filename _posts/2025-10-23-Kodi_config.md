# First enable unknown sources:
![](/img/Pasted image 20250929102951.png)

Then head to file manager:
![](/img/Pasted image 20250929103109.png)

![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120224.png)

Add source:

![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120355.png)

Enter the package url and name it whatever you like as long as you remember it

Package URL:

```http
https://kodifitzwell.github.io/repo/
```

Create a recognizable name for the package repo. If you mess anything up and Kodi takes you back to the File Manager, long press on the source and you can edit it.

Go back one level and choose Add-ons:

![](/img/Pasted image 20250929103335.png)

Install from zip:
![](/img/Pasted image 20250929103401.png)

Select the title of the link you added in File Manager from the previous step:
![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120627.png)

The zip file for your repo will show up, select it.

![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120652.png)

Sucees!

Now we need to install the application from the newly installed repo:
![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120753.png)

This method works for basically any repo install in Kodi. For POV use this one:

![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120806.png)

POV is in Video add-ons:

![](/img/Pasted image 20250930120819.png)

Select this option to install POV:

Now you just need to authorize real-debrid, or whatever your premium content provider is and enable Trakt if you would like to track your episode progress whether locally or across different devices.


Until next time!
