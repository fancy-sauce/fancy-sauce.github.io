Welcome to a little explanation of what I've learned so far in wifi exploitation and defense. A lot of the post is going
to cover tools that can be found installed by default in Kali, so using that system is going to make your life a lot easier.
Installation of Kali would be the easiest and most straightforward setup to get going. Next would be a virtual machine with a usb wifi adapter plugged in. Also, your going to need a 2.4ghz
wireless adapter capable of injecting packets. These are some that I've used with great results and they range from $10-$30.

airodump -ng start wlan0

Should give you feedback on if your adapter is supported or not.

**Warning:** Make sure your adapter supports wireless injection. If not, your attacks will not work!

[Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net) is "a wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework." It's awesome at detecting common attacks, but even better at displaying information about wireless devices. In our case we will use it to discover channels a particular AP is connected to, view hidden access points, and view connected devices to those access points.

If your having trouble with the software, [Discord](https://discord.gg/5N4ME9a) is an efficient method of support. The community is very helpful and welcoming, you'll get an answer much quicker than on a forum.
