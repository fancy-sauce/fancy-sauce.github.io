Hello, and welcome to my explanation of what I've learned so far in wifi exploitation and defense. A lot of the post is going
to cover tools that can be found installed by default in Kali, so using that system is going to make your life a lot easier.
Virtual machines are my recommended way of using this, or even booting off a usb3 drive. Also, your going to need a 2.4ghz
wireless adapter capable of injecting packets. If your lucky, your laptop supports this by default.

```
airodump -ng start wlan0
```
Should give you feedback on if your adapter is supported or not.

**Warning:** Make sure your adapter supports wireless injection. If not, your attacks will not work!
