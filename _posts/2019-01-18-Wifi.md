# Intro

Welcome to a little explanation of what I've learned so far in wifi exploitation and defense. Most of the attacks are found within Wifite, a collection of Python scripts that make it very easy carry out attacks against most commonly used 802.11 encryption protocols on private and public access points. There are other attacks that are more, destructive, without necessarily a rhyme or reason behind them, like using MDK3 to disconnect users constantly from an access point. Then we move on to a method of connecting to open access points that require a portal for authentication. Instead, we use a tool to impersonate a connected client and bypass this restriction. Then we have some scouting tools like Wigle.net and Kismet to help find certain access points and even detect attacks. If we have time there is even methods for tracking wifi enabled devices that show how easy it is to track people. Hopefully you learn something new to help improve your network security, cheat the system, and lessen the effectiveness of the privacy goblins we carry in our pockets everyday.

# Software needed
---
Installation of Kali would be the easiest and most straightforward setup to get going. This tutorial covers tools that can be found installed by default in Kali, so using that system is going to make your life a lot easier. Next would be a Kali VM with a usb wifi adapter plugged in.

If you can't do any of those options or have a linux distro you can't be without, install this package list:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kismet, aircrack-ng, mdk3, tcpdump, macchanger -y
git clone https://github.com/derv82/wifite2.git
```

# Hardware needed
In addition to the software, a simple 2.4ghz wireless adapter capable of injecting packets is necessary for wifi fun. These are some that I've used with great results and they range from $10-$30.

**Notice:**
The APs to attack are labeled with the prefix DC509, we are not giving permission to attack any other points.

# Attacks
---

## Wifite


Wifite will be our go-to tool for retrieving access point passwords.

## WEP

WEP cracking with it is something trivial, but for some reason not so much when setting up on our test router using [ddwrt](https://www.dd-wrt.com). The router takes the configuration but clients cannot connect to it. So for this, I'm going to just go over the theory of this attack. First we boot up wifite and run it against DC509-1:
```
wifite -WEP -i wlan0mon
```
After running this for a bit near a WEP point it will start to populate in the list. Quit the scan using ```ctrl+c``` and enter the number associated with the target access point. Wifite will then start working through the available attack scripts in its toolbox. With a weak password and a client connected to the access point you'll catch enough IV's (initialization vectors) to start cracking. In our lab test we set up an access point using a password from the rockyou wordlist and cracked it in seconds.

## WPA/2

Wifite can also be used to target WPA/2 encryption:

```
wifite -i --wpa wlan0mon
```
Wifite will start looking for access points that are secured using WPA/2. Just select the number next to the AP as before and wifite will start working through the list of attacks.

## Bypassing MAC address filtering & avoiding hotel portals

Macchanger is a utility to manipulate the mac address of your network adapter. Using a mac address found through Kismet (found below) we can borrow that same address, sidestepping both captive portals and filters based on mac addresses. It can do a lot more too, such as setting random or permanent macs.

```
macchanger --mac XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0

```

## Disconnecting clients
MDK3 is a tool we can use to perform several different attacks as well. If we run the following command we can constantly disconnect clients. (Make sure your adapter is in monitor mode) Pretty fun!
```
sudo mdk3 wlan0 d
```

# Finding our targets
---

## Kismet

[Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net) describes itself as "a wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework."

It's awesome at detecting common attacks, but even better at displaying information about wireless devices and networks. In our case we will use it to discover hidden access points and view connected devices to those access points.

Using kismet, we will look at the access points available around us. The more powerful our wireless adapter & antenna, the more data we will capture in the air. (Quality Yagi antennas tailored to 802.11 are awesome)

{: .box-warning}
**Notice:**
If your having trouble with Kismet, this [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5N4ME9a) is the quickest way to get help and the community is very helpful and welcoming.

These tools don't start monitor mode on our adapter as nicely as wifite does, so we have to set it up manually.
```
airodump -ng start wlan0
```
Replace wlan0 with your interface adapter

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** Check your adapter name with ```ifconfig``` Also, you might need to bring your interface down first, run airmon-ng, then start it back up for it to work properly. Airmon-ng renames monitor mode interfaces by appending "mon" to the original interface name.

```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng start wlan0
ifconfig wlan0mon up
```

Running Kismet is as easy as typing ```kismet -i wlan0mon```

This starts the webserver automatically and is located at ```127.0.0.1:2501``` just put this into your browser.

We can check our login creds with:
```
cat ~username/.kismet/kismet_httpd.conf
```
Once logged in, select the three-lined menu button in the upper left.
 ![Menu1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fancy-sauce/fancy-sauce.github.io/master/img/kismet_menu.png)

Then select "Data Sources".                                          
![Menu2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fancy-sauce/fancy-sauce.github.io/master/img/kismet_menu2.png)

It may take a moment for all interfaces to show up click on the "Available Interface" dropdown for your device. Select "Enable Source"

Going back to Kismet's main page, because we are in monitor mode, we can see packets going from other access points, not just the ones sent from the wireless point we are connected to normally. The data from users to the AP is still encrypted, but we can see the devices connected to the points, what channels they broadcast on, what the mac address for that AP is and other metadata. The cool thing about this is we can see "hidden" access points as well.

## Wigle.net

Locating vulnerable access points is pretty easy. We can leverage the power of crowd data collection. [Wigle.net](https://www.wigle.net) is a service that collects information about access points and adds them to a database we can search and perform queries on. Tools to build this awesome data service can be as simple as an Android device, to an all-out wardriving rig. I've build these setups in the past using a gps module, raspberry pi, alfa card, and a portable battery pack. It's not nearly as easy to get data into Wigle this way, but you do have more control over what information gets to them, such as your (super basic) device information. Android device are great for this because they come with everything and installation is quick from the Google Play Store.

Anyways, jump onto the site and register for an account. Once that is done, login and go to "View" in the top menu. Then "Advanced Search". Finally, lets search for all WEP "encryption status" APs in Chicago. Stale information isn't going to help us as most of the WEP points are gone nowadays, so lets filter by the last year by entering the "last observed" info. Easy, right?

{: .box-warning}
**Notice:**
The time/date format is: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

Boom, these are all the extremely vulnerable access points that MAY still exist and a simple Wigle scan would verify this.

## Probesniffer
All 802.11 devices need a way to find an access point they have previously connected to. Usually, this is done with probe requests. Your devices yells out in public a last known SSID it has associated with. If that matches with an AP nearby, we get a response confirming and start the handshake process to connect with it. When our device says this in public, its like yelling a home address, especially when that SSID has been recorded within Wigle's database. Try the following [python script](https://github.com/xdavidhu/probeSniffer). It records prove requests and saves it into a nicely organized sqlite file we can query later or reference in another script. You need to manually place your adapter into monitor mode.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip tshark -y
git clone https://github.com/xdavidhu/probeSniffer
cd probeSniffer/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

sudo python3 probeSniffer.py wlan0mon

That's it for now, thanks for stopping by!
