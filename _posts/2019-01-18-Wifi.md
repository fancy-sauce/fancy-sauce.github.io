Welcome to a little explanation of what I've learned so far in wifi exploitation and defense. The first task is to understand the access points and devices that communicate via 802.11. For this reconaissance we will use a few tools such as wigle.net which can look up access points and determine their origin on a map. With these applications and skills we will put it into effect by gaining access to hotel wifi. This helps a lot if your unwilling to give the captive portals at many hotel chains your personal information. We can gain access to points that are a little more secure, using tools that can break the security of most access points in use today. Finally, lets just wreak havok and disconnect everyone from a particular access point, forcing them to reconnect or log back in. All of these attacks are to understand common attacks and defend against them.

A lot of the post is going to cover tools that can be found installed by default in Kali, so using that system is going to make your life a lot easier.

## The Setup
---
Installation of Kali would be the easiest and most straightforward setup to get going. Next would be a virtual machine with a usb wifi adapter plugged in. Also, your going to need a 2.4ghz wireless adapter capable of injecting packets. These are some that I've used with great results and they range from $10-$30.

## Recon

Start your adapter in monitor mode via:
```
airodump -ng start wlan0
```
Replace wlan0 with your interface adapter

**Warning:** Check your adapter name with ```ifconfig``` Also, you might need to bring your interface down first, run airmon-ng, then start it back up for it to work properly. Airmon-ng renames monitor mode interfaces by appending "mon" to the original interface name.

```
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng start wlan0
ifconfig wlan0mon up
```

[Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net) describes itself as "a wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework."

It's awesome at detecting common attacks, but even better at displaying information about wireless devices and networks. In our case we will use it to discover hidden access points and view connected devices to those access points.

Using kismet, we will look at the access points available around us. The more powerful our wireless adapter & antenna, the more data we will capture in the air. (Quality Yagi antennas tailored to 802.11 are awesome)

**Notice:**
If your having trouble with Kismet, this [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5N4ME9a) is the quickest way to get help and the community is very helpful and welcoming.

Running Kismet is as easy as typing ```kismet -i wlan0mon```
The webui after running this command is located at 127.0.0.1:2501
